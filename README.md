# Opinion Dynamics: The Bounded Confidence Model

This is a repository on the bounded confidence model of opinion dynamics, as first put forward by [Hegselmann & Krause](https://www.jasss.org/5/3/2.html). This repository contains code for the model and for some visualizations.

## 1. Setup
To run the project, you first need to install the required packages
```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 2. The model `model.py`
The class `BoundedConfidence` in the module `model.py` is an implementation of the bounded confidence model. 

## 3. Visualization `visualize.py`
The method `visualize` in the module `visualize.py` can be used to visualize the run of a bounded confidence model.
